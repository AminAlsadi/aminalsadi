Room 8: Regression - Predicting ChatGPT Usage
Use a simple regression to predict the ChatGPT usage for next
week based on historical usage data.
def predict_usage ( usage_values ) :
diff = usage_values [ -1] - usage_values [0]
slope = diff / ( len ( usage_values ) - 1)
return usage_values [ -1] + slope
# Historical data : hrs of usage in the past 4 weeks
usage_values = [50 , 60 , 70 , 80]
next_week_usage = ...
print ( f " Predicted ChatGPT usage for next week : {...}")
