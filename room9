Room 9: Data Normalization - Prepare Sensor Data for
Comparison
You have sensor data from diff. machines. The readings are
on diff. scales, transform it to be consistent for comparison.
def transform ( data ) :
....
# Sensor data with varying ranges
sensor_data = [500 , 1200 , 3000 , 8000]
normalized_data = transform ( sensor_data )
print ( f " Normalized data : {...}")
