Room 5: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
The factory wants to group similar machine readings to detect
unusual patterns. Write a program to ”cluster” data based on
proximity to a threshold.
data = [3.1 , 2.9 , 5.4 , 6.2 , 1.9 , 5.7]
threshold = 3.5
cluster_1 = [ x for x in ... if ...]
cluster_2 = [ x for x in ... if ...]
print ( f " Cluster 1: { cluster_1 }")
print ( f " Cluster 2: { cluster_2 }")
